# MRTMLY-002: LoadingPhase Act Warnings Debugging Session

**Date:** 2024-12-19  
**Tags:** #debugging #tests #react-testing #act-warnings #loading-phase  
**Status:** In Progress  

## Initial State

- LoadingPhase tests are passing (8/8) but showing numerous "act" warnings
- Every test that uses timers (setTimeout) generates act warnings
- Error message: "An update to LoadingPhase inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)"
- This indicates React state updates happening outside of act() wrapping

## Debug Process

### 1. First Investigation
- **Examined:** LoadingPhase component and its tests
- **Found:** Component uses setTimeout for minimum load duration
- **Issue:** Tests advance timers with vi.advanceTimersByTime() but don't wrap state updates in act()

### 2. Root Cause Analysis
- React Testing Library expects async state updates to be wrapped in act()
- Our LoadingPhase component triggers state updates via setTimeout
- Test utilities advance timers but don't account for React's need to flush updates

### 3. Solution Strategy
- Need to wrap timer advances in act() from React Testing Library
- May need to use waitFor() for state changes that depend on timers
- Should update test utilities to handle async updates properly

## Solution Attempts

### Attempt 1: Import and use act() in tests
- Plan: Import act from @testing-library/react and wrap timer advances
- Expected outcome: Clean up act warnings while maintaining test functionality

## Next Steps

1. Fix act warnings in LoadingPhase tests
2. Update test utilities if needed for async timer handling
3. Verify all tests still pass after fixes
4. Document best practices for timer-based component testing

## Lessons Learned (To be updated)

- React state updates in tests must be wrapped in act()
- Timer-based components require special handling in tests
- Test utilities should account for React's rendering lifecycle
